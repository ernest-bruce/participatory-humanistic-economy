# Participatory Humanistic Economy

&nbsp;


> the explorers of the future are observing us with wonder and open minds, but they are learning the wrong message from their elders  
> – we are not for the unbounded enrichment of selfish entities vested only in growing their influence and increasing their wealth to make humanity into a machine, to further their influence and power  
> – humanity is a messenger and our message is us, what makes us *us*, our thoughts and ideals, our dreams for the humanities of the future

the **Participatory Humanistic Economy** comprises earth, individuals, groups of people, and organizations known as *participatory humanistic democracies*  

the [**human internet**][human_internet] is an initiative that empowers people with true ownership and control over their personal data and digital life   
– sadly, the human internet cannot be implemented on top of our misguided socioeconomic systems, which are not designed to protect our environment, our human rights, and our prized possessions, especially our data  
· those systems are designed to protect the wealth and power of the entities who control the means of production while doing little to no actual work  
· this only gets us to the inequalities and injustices from which societies across the world are suffering   

the Participatory Humanistic Economy is a values-based economy  
· a **values-based economy** is guided by human values, such as trust, honesty, liberty, transparency, fairness, respect, and knowledge  
· these are ideals or possessions that individuals, organizations, societies, or the entire human race want to attain or use to realize even higher values    
– the instrumental basis used in the decision-making processes of contemporary socioeconomic systems, such as capitalism and corporatism, not only do not use human values, they exclude them by elevating the maximization of profit as an ideal to which even human life is secondary  
– in its drive to maximize efficiency and reduce waste (to maximize profits), these systems remove humanity from entities that are made up of humans (corporations), and turns them into a soulless machine, in which these humans hold little or no responsibility for the catastrophes that the entity causes in the name of *maximizing profit*  
· this is true even when it is proven that human life was lost due to cost-reduction or revenue-increasing decisions taken by the humans in charge   
– individuals form meaningful connections with the entities that, thru their behavior and actions, prove not only their authenticity but also that they are virtuous in the eyes of the individuals who fuel the economy through their interactions  
· when an entity—through actions or behavior that is negligent, incompetent, unjust, criminal, or not virtuous, for example—does not meet or betrays the values of an individual to whom it is connected or with whom it interacts, that individual can break the connection to or cease interacting with the offending entity, and choose one that is more compatible with zir values  

the Participatory Humanistic Economy is the grass-roots system that empowers individuals to ensure that their environment is protected, and that the entities use shared environments efficiently and responsibly, while adhering to human values that advance the status of all individuals, and that improve the tools at humanitys disposal to ensure its endurance and spread among the stars
