## transportation
as a driver, do you really need Lyft or Uber?  
– no  
· all you need is an open, public, and shared platform that gathers individual drivers like yourself and offers riding services to the public  
– you and many others can help develop this open, shared platform so that you can be in TOTAL control of your work and your time

## timekeeping
ideal: Truth  
goal: adopt the Holocene calendar  

although not yet civilized, humanity has not been *humanity* for only 2020 years  
· we have been living in the Human Era for over 10,000 years  
– to give homage to our transition from hunter-gatherers to settlement dwellers, we must adopt the Holocene calendar, just before we start colonizing our solar system, before we venture out of our celestial crib to live off the heat of other stars

the Planetonomy’s official calendar is the Holocene calendar  
– all dates use the Holocene calendar  
– to facilitate interactions with entities outside the Planetonomy, conversions between the Gregorian and Holocene calendars are acceptable (adding or removing “1” from the left of the year) until the year 12100 HE 
· after that, no conversions are acceptable  
· it is Human Era all the time

## ecological catastrophes
make it rain water in hot, dry conditions  
– could Moses West’s water-from-air technology be massively scaled down and then up to produce rain over hot and dry spaces to squelch or prevent fires?
