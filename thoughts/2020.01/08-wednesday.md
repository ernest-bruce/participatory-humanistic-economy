## problem: laws and regulations are ineffective against resourceful and well-funded entities

our economic system is broken  
· left to its own devices, entities with power use it in ways that diminish the power of entities that are not as powerful, including the consumers who fund the system with their interactions  
· collectively, these individuals could force the powerful entities to change their ways
· but to do that they need information and a system that forces entities to behave according to values and ideals, not price and convenience, which result in environmental, ethical, and social deficits  

the market is like a battlefield in which the most powerful armies win, the small players (the soldiers) are maimed or die  
– we try to address this discrepancy with legislation, regulation, and financial incentives  
· but it is easy to see that the powerful entities lobby or [litigate](https://youtu.be/dUgtD-DIL_s "The Machine That's Silencing #MeToo on Wall Street") their way out of responsibility and accountability for their actions  
– legislation and regulation are essentially controlled by the entities whose actions need to be legislated and regulated (Amazon, Apple, Boeing, Equifax, Facebook) the same entities who publicly ask for more regulation while, at the same time, they influence the people writing, and approving the laws and regulations  

solution: we need a more responsive system that reflects the values and ideals of all its participants, not just the most powerful ones
· we need the #Planetonomy

## human-machine interfaces

problem: the way people interact with digital devices is arcane, unnatural, ineffective, and frustrating  
– people need better ways to interact with digital devices  
· input methods need to stop recreating the way people typed 60 years ago  
· onscreen keyboards suck  
– workflows are not humane  
· they are made for machines not for humans  
– we need to start over using innovative and effective methodologies  
· and we need to start from the silicon, the processor  
· we need to leave von Neumann behind and explore new possibilities in designing and building [smarter devices](https://youtu.be/Za21GOxVh18 "Building a Computer Like Your Brain")

## artificial intelligence
truly capable and helpful digital agents  
– learn thoroughly a persons schedule, tastes, and other attributes to be able to provide comprehensive assistance  
– help people get their tasks done  


&nbsp;
## problem
most large business entities have not earned the right to capture, control, and use personal data or organizational data to control persons and organizations  
· **Facebook** has admitted to running “experiments” on people using personal data to determine how much influence Facebook can have on a persons behavior (the people were not asked whether they wanted to be subjects for experimentation), which makes Facebook not only untrustworthy but also selfish and predatory, using its position, resources, and access to entity data to control the behavior of its “bait”  



&nbsp;
## values and ideals
– using Amazon is convenient, so is using Facebook and Google  
· but is convenience and price more important that our personal values and ideals?  
· when money is speech, votes, and support, should we “vote for” and support entities that, as persons, would not come close to being our friends?  

it is difficult for us to determine whether the entities we deal with on a daily basis are trustworthy, fair, just, and virtuous, according to our values, beliefs, and ideals, so we ignore those things and base our decisions purely on price and convenience, in a market that is unjust, unfair, and controlled by entities who do not have our benefit, or humanitys benefit, or the earths benefit, as their central goal, a market that is controlled by selfish psychopaths  
· a transparent economy with open platforms that help us determine whether the organizations we deal with would qualify as good friends, as trustworthy friends, and as fair friends, would help us to not only “trust the system” but also to ensure that our own personal economy is made up of entities that share our values and ideals, which embodies democratic tenets of freedom and self-determination  
· we would bring into our lives only entities that (at least in our eyes) represent the values, ideals, and virtues that are important to us  
· and entities who want to relate with us would be able to determine the values, ideals, and virtues that their potential audience holds dear, and adopt them, not just in name but especially in action and behavior  
· when we place values and ideals higher than convenience we are better persons, better citizens, and better humans  

the Planetary Humanistic Economy aims to be the economy for those of us who value our values and our ideals ideals, those of us who believe that our relationships and interactions reflect ourselves, our beliefs, and our hopes for a safer, fairer world, and a more knowledgeable and equitable humanity  



&nbsp;
## democracy
a planetary democracy, a democracy for all people, where the earth, individuals, and humanity are its beneficiaries  
– these are some ideals, values, and virtues for a new economy, centered on our shared environment, human beings, and humanity:
“Planet Occupy is a globalized place. People and their ideas travel freely, creating new opportunities and partnerships wherever they go. Assemblies share their plans and innovations over Interoccupy. (The movement’s conference-call network will have supplanted the original Internet, which was overrun by corporate advertising.) Following the urge in the Principles for “the broad application of open source,” all ideas are common property, and these collective resources are, according to the Statement of Autonomy, valued more highly than money—if money still exists at all. SOPA-style censorship in the name of ownership is not okay.”  

the Planetary Humanistic Economy (Planetonomy) aims to return to individuals the ability to construct their own economy using their values and ideals as a guide and information as a tool  
· this economy has no place for selfish, dishonest, and untrustworthy entities

&nbsp;
## ideal
enable, facilitate, and support work for the improvement of human life, the endurance and resilience of our environment, and the advancement of humanity  



&nbsp;
## shelter communities: providing free, clean, and safe drinking water for residents
– partner with the Water Rescue Foundation  
· develop machines using the foundations atmospheric water generation technology  
– foundation info:  
· goal: provide drinking water to people in need; build productive relationships and make a positive impact with the help of donors  
· mission: help those in need due to geography or disaster  
– how could we partner?    
· in return for machines or support in their manufacture, a PHD shelter community could offer support to the foundation, such as maintaining their website (copyedit and other tasks)  
· the PHD shelter community could also help the foundation to provide machines to communities in need near the communitys location, or as far as is possible

## plant production: growing and sharing marijuana 
– because, why not?

## shelter
building buildings differently to protect our environment  
· new community members help to build their shelters for themselves and others

&nbsp;
## problem
mind manipulation, for profit  
– ads are the scourges of humanity  
ads are largely made by professionals in mind manipulation to make people spend money on things they dont need or to make them engage in activities that are not required for their existence  
– companies contract out the creation of ad campaigns to third·parties, to help them sell their products  
· usually, producers and ad agencies share no values  
· their relationships are largely based on whether the latter create successful ad campaigns for the former  
· as long as the ad agencies deliver consumers to the producers, the relationships are strong  
· when the agencies become ineffective, the relationship is broken  

so consumers are just pawns in the profit-making game that producers and ad agencies play at the expense of people  

ads have no place in the Planetonomy  



&nbsp;
## problem: bureaucracy
bureaucracies are shortcomings of governance that slow benefits to human health and wellbeing  
· humane policies and technology must replace bureaucracy so that benefits to individuals and the environment are awarded as soon as they are needed  
– a bureaucracy (human or system errors) must never be used as excuses to deny the resources an entity needs for its life or operation  
– in the era of Facebook, Instagram, and FaceTime, relying on “technologies” like phone calls, voicemail, and snailmail, for critical interactions is inhumane  


&nbsp;
## values-based life
in the Planetonomy, a person can define zir value profile and use it when performing zir economic interactions  
– for example, when searching for drones or drone accessories to purchase, the search is performed on markets that realize or match the persons values and ideals such as “use renewable energy,” and “human diversity”  
· the search is done across markets that offer drones and drone accessories for sale and that are implemented by entities that use renewable energy in their operations and that include a diverse workplace
