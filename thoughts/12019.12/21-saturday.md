## personal assistants
it would be lovely to be able to deal with a digital assistant that i can trust completely because i know that any personal data i give it access to will not end up being used by entities who do not have my best interests or the best interests of humanity at heart  
– all the digital assistants available today have been compromised, are unreliable, cannot keep up with what people say, and are used to benefit the owners of the companies that implement them  
· we need a system that people can trust implicitly because it is a system dedicated to its users and its owners, which are the *same people*  
· we need a complete system, an socioeconomic and technical system designed, implemented, and operated on behalf of humans and for the realization of their values and ideals, not the ideals and twisted values of entities dedicated only to profit and the creation and maintenance of their owners wealth, influence, and power  
&nbsp;

## working with capitalistic entities
interacting with capitalistic entities  
– just like PHDs interact with capitalistic entities at their level through the market and government, capitalistic entities should be able to interact with PHDs through values, ideals, and virtue  
· capitalistic organizations could cooperate directly with PHDs to realize shared and collective goods without the influence of market and governmental forces  
&nbsp;

## protecting earth
protecting our environment  
– BigBattery appears to be a capitalistic entity that includes environment protection and resource reuse in its core values  
– related entities:  
· RELiB  
· Faraday Institution  
· New Use Energy   
· Hyperdrive Innovation  
· Connected Energy  
· Spiers New Technologies  
· Right to Repair

## killing our userid-password albatrosses
digital life: userid-passwords  
– no more  
· in the PHE, persons do not use userids and passwords to interact digitally  
&nbsp;

## innovative habitats
habitats, space  
– we need to learn to design, construct, and operate habitats in “extreme” environments on earth so that we have knowledge and expertise that helps us to do the same in environmets outside earth  
&nbsp;

## new economy
an economy that works for all people, not just corporations and the *very* rich  
– we need an economy that is naturally geared to benefit its participants, especially individuals and the environment  
· our current systems are rife for abuse by powerful entities who look only after their own benefit  
– we need a system that allows people to interact effectively with entities they dont know personally but that adhere to a persons values an ideals, not only those that offer convenience or a good price (there are more important aspects to consider in the production, attainment, and consumption of goods)  
&nbsp;

## ideal: health is a human right
&nbsp;

## eliminate gullible people with education
education  
– we must ensure that people, especially children, are educated to value human rights, life, and truth  
· this helps to reduce the chances of them falling for lies or the charms of influences that are not vested in their benefit, but in making them to do things against their own interest  
– we need to ensure that societies dont produce rapists, killers, and gullible people  
&nbsp;

## scarcity
ideal: eliminate scarcity  
– help civilize humanity through truth, knowledge, empathy, fairness, justice  
&nbsp;

## critical thinking
goal: enable critical thinking  
– help people to have the information that is relevant to their task  
· help them weight ideas and concepts based on available factual data  
· help them make decisions based on their values and ideals, relevant information and data, and the opinions of entities that they trust  


objective (enable critical thinking goal):  
– app that helps people state, discover, and understand their values  
&nbsp;

## renewable energy
goal: provide free or very low cost renewable energy to homes or communities with low penetration of such technology, using reliable, practical, and good-looking implementation like solar trees, which can be installed in yards and community parks to provide shade, power plugs, in addition to saving power in batteries to offset high power rates during hours of peak power consumption  
– this could be beneficial in new housing communities where the majority of residents may not want to install ugly solar panels on their roofs and whose roofs are too new to be replaced with beautiful solar shingles, from Tesla and other companies  
· <https://spotlightsolar.com/products>  
· [solar trees in South Florida](https://youtu.be/8d7J5wAtdn4 "YouTube: FPL introduces solar trees to South Florida")   
– how could the participatory-humanistic-democracy organization that installs those systems doing it for free?  
· first, try operate primarily out of the market and governmental spheres  
· deal with stakeholders in the personal, social, cultural, and transcendental spheres, using their logic and inherent currency (reputation, trust, altruism, good will)  
· use the market and government (legislation, regulations, grants, programs, and so on) as necessary  
– issues:  
· what are the consequences of providing free equipment and labor to individuals and communities?  
· who gets the tax benefits, if any, the party that purchases and installs the equipment of the property owner); i thing the former, but im not a lawyer or policy expert  
· [experiences with solar](https://youtu.be/LvoLyQfesL8  "YouTube: I've Had Solar for 8 Years: Here's Everything I've Learned")  
– benefits  
· solar trees provide shade without leaves  
· the dont mess with sidewalks as their roots dont grow after installation   
· you can sit under them, enjoy the shade, and charge your devices  
· communicate your value of using renewable energy beautifully and practically
