## PHE Goals
true and total interoperability between products and services from different companies (no data silos, true choice and flexibility for consumers)  
– companies earn customer loyalty, they dont use their power, currency, or influence (in legislation and law enforcement) to force people to use only their products, which may have flaws that products from other companies do not have

about personal assistants  
– a person needs *one* personal agent that zie can trust implicitly, and that is available everywhere zie needs it  
. (the days of multiple assistants with multiple capabilities, different hardware requirements, and multiple ways of frustrating people, are numbered)  
– and that agent is not run by an untrustworthy and unreliable for-profit enterprise, whose main goal is the enrichment of its owners, regardless of what its executives say in public (they are often contradicted by insiders and internal documents)  
– the agent runs on all the trustworthy devices under the control of the person or a trustworthy, responsible, and virtuous organization that has as its highest priority the privacy, security, and safety of the person and zir data  

would you trust the care of your newborn to a cute but hungry bear?  
– trusting your personal data to a data-driven for-profit organization like #Amazon, #Apple, #Facebook, #Google,  #Microsoft, #Twitter, or many others, makes as much sense  
– apologies are not enough to redeem companies that betray your trust, either on purpose or through incompetence  
. data-driven companies that suffer data breaches *of any kind* or actually disclose personal data through internal processes, such as interactions with contractors, are nothing less than incompetent, regardless of speeches from their smooth-talking CEOs

## innovative habitats
– design and construct habitats—for families, communities, and businesses—that embrace sea-level rise  
. for example, underwater habitats that are very close to current at-risk cities like Miami Beach  
– these habitats could provide living, working, or both, environments that are different from the standard and that provide lessons, knowledge, and expertise to be used in the habitats of the future, outside earth

## science
why Musk and Bezos dont build telescopes?  
– because science for the advancement of humanity is not incredibly profitable for them or their investors  
· simple

## entrepreneurship
.#ParticipatoryHumanisticEconomy

improving entrepreneurship and benefiting consumers  
– by establishing a collective digital infrastructure that implements markets, social interactions, automation, and other necessary processes, entrepreneurs find lower barriers of entry to industries that are not controlled by a single powerful player who takes choice away from users (Amazon)  
· users benefit by having many options as the sources of products or services, whose reliability and security is provided by the collective infrastructure  
· the product manufacturers and service providers can enhance their offerings with added value, and do not keep customers hostage by introducing artificial incompatibilities to “beat” the competition (Amazon wants to destroy FedEx and has taken away that shipping option from its customers, which, by the way, also make up its competition)  
· <https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/16/tech/amazon-prime-fedex-ground-shipments/index.html>  
· people are free to try many offerings and use the one, or the few, that provide the most attractive experience for them  

the PHE seeks to benefit individuals and entities fairly, conveniently, and efficiently, which is anathema to for-profit organizations, vested only in selfish enrichment and the total destruction of their “enemies”
