# The Participatory Humanistic Economy Blog

i have been working on an initiative to empower people when it comes to their digital lives, especially control over their personal data  
– the previous phase involved the creation of an alternative to Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter, and other powerfuld data silo–owning companies whose first priority *is not* the benefit of individuals or humanity but their self-enrichment through profit-maximizing practices which include betraying their proclamatios of “keeping user data safe”  
· these are some documents i wrote about that: RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
– however, i have to widen the scope of this initiative  

a couple of month ago, i was introduced to something called *cooperatives*  
– you probably know about them already  
· so did i, or so i thought  
– but this time i read about their origins, the problems they aim to solve, their principles and values  
· i learned about the Rochdale Principles
– i also have been reading about Chile, Hong Kong, The Soviet Union, China, Taiwan, and other jurisdictios that are going through chaos  

so i widened the scope of my research  
– i want to device the open, public ecosystem (digital platforms, policies, practices, principles, and core values) that drives entire *values-based economies*  
– what is a values-based economy?  
· it is an economy that is driven by... values, human values  
· not profit  
· not this caustic profit-at-all-costs culture that is destroying our environment, individuals, and humanity  


i have been further inspired by the three
