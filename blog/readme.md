# The Participatory Humanistic Economy Blog

i have been working on an initiative to empower people when it comes to their digital lives, especially control over their personal data  
– the previous phase involved the creation of an alternative to Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter, and other powerfuld data silo–owning companies whose first priority *is not* the benefit of individuals or humanity but their self-enrichment through profit-maximizing practices which include betraying their proclamatios of “keeping user data safe”  
· these are some documents i have written about that: [Human Internet][human_internet]
– however, while observing current events and learning about social enterprises (cooperatives) i have come to the realization that theh human internet cannot be implemented using our current descructive sociopolitical frameworks
– we need frameworks that put people, their lives, and their ecology first  

a couple of months ago, i was introduced to something called *cooperatives*  
– you probably know about them already  
· so did i, or so i thought  
– but this time i read about their origins, the problems they aim to solve, their principles and values  
· i learned about the Rochdale Principles
– i also have been reading about Chile, Hong Kong, The Soviet Union, China, Taiwan, and other jurisdictios that are going through chaos, fomented by misguided, power·hungry, and corrupt leadership

so i widened the scope of my research  
– i want to device the open, public ecosystem (digital platforms, policies, practices, principles, and core values) that drives entire *values-based economies*  
– what is a values-based economy?  
· it is an economy that is driven by... values, human values  
· not profit  
· not this caustic profit-at-all-costs culture that is destroying our environment, individuals, and humanity  

i have been further inspired by three people who have written about developing an economy that is greater tha any individual, company, or government, that puts our only home, humans, and humanity first  
· these inspiring human beings are Larry Chang, Arjo Klamer, and Lee Ann, who wrote:

* [*Notes for a Planetary Economy—A Values-Based System*][https://www.larrychang.info/writings/Notes%20for%20a%20Value-based%20Economy.pdf]  
* [*Doing the Right Thing: A Value Based Economy*][https://repub.eur.nl/pub/109438/doing-the-right-thing..pdf]  
* [“Will Millennials Drive the Shift from a Consumption-Based to a Values-Based Economy?”][https://sustainablebrands.com/read/behavior-change/will-millennials-drive-the-shift-from-a-consumption-based-to-a-values-based-economy]


i read Chang’s paper  
- it describes the essential components of a platform that could drive a value-based economy based on the earths resources  
- his ideas could be adapted to be used in an open, digital platform, the Planecology platform, that people and organizations, communities, and societies use to manage their operations and interactions  
· closed, private platforms will still exist, but there will always be alternatives based on an open foundation using private-data ownership values  

Klamer describes a value-based economy focused on human belonging, connection, and culture  
- adding his ideas to the initiative would give it depth and a more “human touch,” something to which some people could be very attracted  

Ann’s focus on the Millennials’s pursuit of “experiences” and their dedication to the environment tells me that we’re on the right track because they “comprise the largest age cohort ever”  

combining these four approaches could give rise to a the foundation of the next economic model *and* actual implementation that may provide a novel alternative to the failed models that have mired us in unfairness, inequality, and social strife
