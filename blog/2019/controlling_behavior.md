after arriving in a new town, you befriend a few people, one of them seems talks very highly of zirself, but seems otherwise a nice person  
· however, after a while that person starts lying, spreading rumors about you, and stealing your property  
· to protect yourself, you end your friendship with that person  
· and to protect the people with whom both of you share a friendship, you inform them of the action you took and why you took it  
· people have used this way of influencing their personal environment for thousands of years  

but we do not have that option when it comes to our relationships with entities like powerful corporations   
· even though many of them lie to their customers and the public all the time, manipulate your property to profit, and protect their people from prosecution by hiding them behind the “corporate entity,” we have little recourse but continue to use their services, or go without a need, such as safe travel or efficient communication with our friends and family  
· in some cases, we have no choice  

all the credit bureaus have been negligent with highly sensitive personal data  
· **Equifax** lost control of the data of millions of people, yet no one has been prosecuted as a result, and the company continues to trade with that data  
– **Boeing** has been found culpable for the death of 346 people as a result implementing systems (including software and yoke actuators) that override pilot commands, and of hiding that information from pilots  
· the company has also been accused by whistleblowers of producing planes using defective parts and even leaving equipment inside fuselages, endangering the lives of millions of people worldwide  
– **Facebook** lies about its personal·data processing and sharing practices   
– **Amazon** engages in predatory practices against its own customers  

but, because these companies provide products and services without which individuals and businesses cannot operate efficiently, or even effectively, we keep interacting with them, even though with their actions and behavior they betray the values they espouse, and violate our rights of privacy and safety  
– these companies use the economic system to profit from us and use the legal system to limit or eliminate individual choice  
· they have effectively rigged the market, government, and the judicial systems for their benefit  
– rich and influential entities manipulate markets and legislation in their favor, allowing themselves to operate unfairly and criminally with impunity  
– these companies must answer to a higher authority, higher than the market, and higher than regulations  
· that authority is *you, the consumer*  

the participatory humanistic economy is an environment in which individuals, communities, and businesses can influence the behavior of the entities with whom they interact more effectively than markets, rules, and regulations can  

what is more powerful than markets and legislation?  
· trust, reputation, virtue  
· these are assets that no company can buy or regulate  
– Facebook, Boeing, Amazon, Equifax
· these are untrustworthy entities
· they have earned their untrustworthiness through their actions and behavior
· to safe face, some of them have asked for regulation  
· they do this because they do not want to take responsibility for their own actions  
· they want to blame others for their data mismanagement, malfeasance, and other activity that people naturally find repugnant and would not tolerate from their personal friends

> *i feel like if i was to talk to Boeing, i would say i feel cheated, that i don’t get to see our son be a father, our other son be an uncle*—[Susan Ripple](https://youtu.be/QytfYyHmxtc?t=1852), mother of two victims of Boeing’s criminality  

&nbsp;  

people cannot trust the market or government regulation to curb the misbehavior of the companies who decide to behave badly, irresponsibly, incompetently, or criminally  
– but people have access to more effective mechanisms of curbing such behavior  
· these mechanisms are driven by their values and ideals  

in the participatory humanistic economy, companies can either truly represent the values and ideals that they espouse publicly, or make do without the patronage of entities who believe strongly in their own values and ideals and want to interact only with entities who share them, and whose actions and behavior serve as testaments to their adherence
